To reflect how to program currently functions on our server, the files most needed are "application.py", "complete.html", "gallery.html", 
and "upload.html". "complete.html", "gallery.html", and "upload.html" are all in a folder called "templates" that "application.py" accesses
to run the program. We also have a folder called "images" that begins empty but will be filled with the photos that are uploaded. We are
experimenting with different css stylings to try to aesthetically improve the program's appearance, but the above mentioned files are all
that should be needed for now. Currently none of these programs access the database, as that is something we are currently working on 
implementing.
